// This module contains reusable UI widgets that can be shared across different renderers
// For now, the widgets are integrated directly into the renderers, but they could be
// extracted here for better reusability if needed in the future.

// Example widgets that could be extracted:
// - ProcessTable
// - ActionPanel
// - TotalsBar
// - AlertProgressBar
